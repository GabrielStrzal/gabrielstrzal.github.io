title: Learning Different Languages to improve as a Developper
published: false
---

(TODO)
Recentry I have been in the mist of a questions:
Should I learn a new programming language? 

Well, I think there is room for improvement if Id started learning a new language, like C++ or Python.

the idea is that if I see things from a different perspective, they could make things better for my current Java centred job.



Points that would impulse me into it:
- more options
- more ideas and maybe understanding
- flexing muscles that might be stuck

  Disadvantages:
  - losing time studying something else
  - could lead is into confusion

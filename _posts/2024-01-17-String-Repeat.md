## String repeat

I was doing some CodeWars challanges and this looked interesting:

```Write a function that accepts an integer n and a string s as parameters, and returns a string of s repeated exactly```

initially my guess is to brute force this challenge to just append things:

Some of the solutions:
- Stringbuilder
  ```sb.append(string);```
- Simple Strings
  ```s += string```
- String methods
  ```string.repeat(repeat);```

which is the best?
